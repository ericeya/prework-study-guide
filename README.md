# Prework Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
    I wanted to learn coding and how it works in real life.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    The usage of github was a very important step to understanding how software engineers in real life worked.
- What problem does it solve?
    This helps me understand the gearworks of how changes are made and websites are built and deployed.
- What did you learn?
    I've learned how to use git commands to push / commit and doing pull requests.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
